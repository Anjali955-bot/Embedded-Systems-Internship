# Task 4 – Speech Recognition System

## Objective
To build a basic speech recognition system for command-based device control.

## Software Used
- Python
- SpeechRecognition Library
- PyAudio
- Google Speech API

## Working Principle
The microphone captures voice input.
The SpeechRecognition library converts speech into text using Google API.
The program checks for keywords like "ON" and "OFF".
Based on the detected command, it simulates device control.

## Output
When the user says:
- "ON" → Device turns ON
- "OFF" → Device turns OFF
- "EXIT" → Program stops

## Note
This system was implemented on a laptop due to hardware unavailability.
