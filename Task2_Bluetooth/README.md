# Task 2 – Bluetooth Controlled Home Automation

## Objective
To design a Bluetooth-based home automation system to switch devices ON and OFF.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno (Simulated)
- LED (Represents appliance)
- 220 ohm Resistor

## Software Used
- Tinkercad Simulation
- Arduino Code

## Working Principle
In this project, Bluetooth communication is simulated using Serial Monitor.
When the user sends '1', the LED turns ON.
When the user sends '0', the LED turns OFF.
The LED represents a home appliance.

## Output
The device successfully turns ON and OFF based on user input.

## Note
Bluetooth is simulated using Serial communication due to hardware unavailability.
