# Task 3 – Temperature Monitoring System with LCD

## Objective
To design a temperature monitoring system that reads temperature data
from a sensor and displays it on a 16x2 LCD.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno (Simulated)
- TMP36 Temperature Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Potentiometer
- Jumper Wires

## Software Used
- Tinkercad (Simulation)
- Arduino IDE (Code)

## Working Principle
The TMP36 sensor produces an analog voltage proportional to temperature.
The Arduino reads the analog value from pin A0 and converts it into
temperature in Celsius.
The temperature is displayed on the 16x2 LCD screen in real-time.

## Output
The LCD displays the current temperature in Celsius and updates every second.

## Note
This project was simulated using Tinkercad due to hardware unavailability.
