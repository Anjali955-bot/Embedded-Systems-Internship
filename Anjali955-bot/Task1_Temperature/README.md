# Task 1 – Temperature Monitoring System

## Objective
To read temperature data using a temperature sensor and display it on the Serial Monitor.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno (Simulated)
- TMP36 Temperature Sensor
- Jumper Wires

## Software Used
- Tinkercad (Simulation)
- Arduino IDE (Code)

## Working Principle
The TMP36 sensor generates an analog voltage proportional to temperature.
The Arduino reads this analog value from pin A0, converts it into voltage,
and then calculates the temperature in Celsius.
The result is displayed on the Serial Monitor every 1 second.

## Output
The Serial Monitor displays real-time temperature values in °C.

## Note
This project was simulated using Tinkercad due to hardware unavailability.
